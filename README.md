This is a test project for an online pen and paper rpg platform where players and GM can communicate in real time.

Current state is this:
- Only a local website for now
- Sending information in real time through SignalR between different persons connected to a session
- Messages, rolls, map and token position are shared between members

Next steps:
- Better management of map
- Different screen for GM and party members to limit actions to GM
- Uploading maps and tokens
- Better security management
- WPF desktop app connecting to the online session
